* Overview

** What it is

   XFN Spider is a tool to extract microformatted content from XHTML
   Friends Networks. It consists of a set of XSLT stylesheets and
   Python wrapper script. It also has several stylsheets to use
   results in 3rd party applications.

** How does it work

*** XSLT to extract µf from pages

    `mf-extract.xsl` currently extracts `<a></a>` elements with `rel=""`
    attributes conforming to XFN and rel-tag microformats using XPath expressions.
    
    The result of applying transformation to a valid (X)HTML document
    is something like this:

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <site url="http://frobong.probnification.com">
          <title>Frobong probnification</title>
          <rss>http://frobong.probnification.com/feeds/posts</rss>
          <relations>
            <rel url="http://hardwaremaniacs.org/golb" type="colleague"/>
            <rel url="http://blog.romashkin.ru" type="friend colleague"/>
            <rel url="http://supablog.livejournal.com" type="acquaintance colleague"/>
            <rel url="http://tangas.sale.net" type="neighbor contact"/>
            <rel url="http://www.urinal.ru" type="date colleague"/>
            <rel url="http://journal.cn" type="met friend colleague co-resident"/>
          </relations>               
          <tags>
            <tag>sex</tag>
            <tag>drugs</tag>
            <tag>rock&roll</tag>
          </tags>
        </site>

*** Python program to process XFN network recursively

    The `xfn-spider.py` script extracts microformats first from the
    «entry-point» page, then from all pages which are XFN-related to
    the first and so on.

    Recursive process actually consists of three steps:

    1. Process current URL (apply XSLT `mf-extract.xsl`)
    2. Calculate a list of URLs to process next (apply another XSLT
       `get-urls.xsl` to get plain list of links)
    3. Do the same upon each entry in URL list formed at step 2.

    First script's command-line option is «entry»-page URL, maximum
    processing depth (defaults to 1) comes second. Depth 0 means only
    to extract XFN links on the very first page.

    Resulting XML file is simply printed to standard output after all
    pages have been processed.

    Usage example:
    
        $ ./xfn-spider.py http://bopik.com 0 > output.xml

    The result of program execution is XML file describing XFN network
    (see `network.dtd`). Example follows:

        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <network>
          <site url="http://bopik.com/">
            <title>Bopik's Writings</title>
            <rss>http://bopik.com/feed.xml</rss>
            <relations>
              <rel url="http://fanfamfax.com" type="friend colleague" />
              <rel url="http://qurinal.com" type="date neighbor" />
            </relations>
            <tags>
              <tag>violence</tag>
              <tag>microformats</tag>
              <tag>phtagn</tag>
            </tags>
          </site>
          <site url="http://qurinal.com">
            <title>qUrinal: best info source for developers</title>
          </site>
          <site url="http://fanfamfax.com">
            <title>F^3</title>
            <rss>http://fanfamfax.com/rss/latest</rss>
          </site>
        </network>

    Please note that `xfn-spider.py` processes pages which are one
    level beyond the maximum depth to extract their titles.

    This format will be extended to respect embedded hCards and
    geotags.

    The result may be processed by `xmllint` with
    `--format` option to pretty-print XML:

        $ xmllint --format output.xml

**** Postprocessing `xfn-spider.py` performs
     Pages with the same titles are considered to be duplicates, so
     only one of them is kept untouched in the resulting XML
     file. Pages parser choked on are kept untouched as empty
     `<site></site>` elements with only `url=""` attributes. See
     `postprocess.xsl` for details.

** What can be done with the resulting XML file

*** Transform the result into a DOT file

    Another XSLT (`make-graphviz.xsl`) is applied to the result of Python
    script execution, transforming high-level XM L data into a DOT
    format graph definition which is to be passed to Graphviz programs
    to create a graphical map of XFN. For example, the following
    command may be used to generate PNG image with XFN graph:

        $ xsltproc make-graphviz.xsl output.xml | dot -Tpng -o network.png
    
    where `output.xml` is the output of `xfn-spider.py`.

    To change style of resulting map you need to edit `make-graphviz.xsl`
    stylesheet! Lines just after `digraph G {` is a good place to set
    general graph options. Please see Graphviz documentation for
    available options.

    Currently `make-graphviz.xsl` shipped with XFN Spider doesn't produce
    really sane DOT files. The stylesheet will be seriously updated in
    future versions.

*** Transform the result into a «Many Eyes»-compliant network description
    Many Eyes is IBM's initiative «for shared visualization and
    discovery». It has features to upload your data and visualize it
    in a bunch of different ways, including visualizing social
    networks.

    Many Eyes' network applet requires data to be formatted in two
    columns separated with `TAB`:

    Person	Knows
    Dmitry	Irina
    Dmitry	Tatyana
    Irina	Dmitry
    Olga	Irina
    Irina	Tatyana
    Tatyana	Olga
    Tatyana	Dmitry

    Let's assume you have `output.xml` as a result of XFN Spider's
    execution.
    
    Extract required data from it:

        $ xsltproc make-manyeyes-network.xsl output.xml > manyeyes.txt
        
    Know you can paste `manyeyes.txt` as a dataset on «Many Eyes».
    
*** Transform the result into a list of RSS feeds in OPML format
    It may sound interesting to get a list of RSS feeds for pages in
    XHTML Friends Network:

        $ xsltproc make-opml.xsl output.xml > xfn-feeds.opml

    Now an `xfn-feeds.opml` file may be imported in your favourite
    feed reading application.

    In order to have its RSS link processed correctly, a page needs to
    contain the following code:

        <link rel="alternate" type="applications/rss+xml"
        href="/url/to/feed" />

    See http://www.w3.org/QA/Tips/use-links for details.

* Requirements

  To run XFN spider, you need recent versions of the following tools:
  - Python
  - libxml2
  - HTML Tidy
  - µtidylib for Python
  
* Quick start

  1. Make `xfn-spider.py` executable:

      $ chmod +x xfn-spider.py

  2. Choose «entry point», processing depth and generate XML file:
     
      $ ./xfn-spider.py http://site-with-xfn.com 2 > output.xml

  3. Try to convert your `output.xml` to OPML feed list:

      $ xsltproc make-opml.xsl output.xml > xfn-feeds.opml

  4. You may also generate many-eyes.com-compliant data set:

      $ xsltproc make-many-eyes.xsl output.xml > manyeyes.txt

* Source files

  Following source files are included:

  1. `xfn-spider.py`: main Python script.

  2. `mf-extract.xsl` and `mf-extract-bottom.xsl`: stylesheets to
     extract microformats from XHTML pages.
     
  3. `mf-extract-bottom.xsl` is applied to pages which are at the
     maximum depth level. It is used to extract *only page titles*.

  4. `postprocess.xsl` cleans up the result of XFN Spider.

  5. `get-urls.xsl`: used to extract plain text list of URLs to be
     processed next.

  6. `make-graphviz.xsl`: example stylesheet to convert `xfn-spider.py`
     result to a DOT file which is to be directed to Graphviz.

  7. `make-manyeyes-network.xsl`: stylesheet to convert result into a Many
     Eyes (many-eyes.com) compliant data set.

  8. `make-manyeyes-tags.xsl`: stylesheet to convert result into a
     list of tags used on pages from XFN.

  9. `make-opml.xsl`: stylesheet to make an OPML file with a list of
     RSS feeds for pages in processed XFN.

  10. `network.dtd`: DTD which may be used to validate the result of
     `xfn-spider.py`. Not used in program. May be broken.

  11. `make-xfn-conds.sh`: service script to generate list of XSLT
     conditional statements to be used in `mf-extract-bottom.xsl` and
     `mf-extract.xsl`. Not used in program. Dirty hack (EXSLT regexps
     should be used instead).
