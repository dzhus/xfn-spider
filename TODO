* TODO [#A] XFN extraction bug
  For example, `rel="cosmetics"` matches current patterns while it
  doesn't comply with XFN format.
* TODO [#B] Respect hCard
* DONE [#C] Tags must be lowercased
  CLOSED: [2007-06-30 Сбт 21:14]
  Currently tags are space-normalized at XFN processing but not
  translated to lowercase.
* TODO [#C] Page title may be way too long for a graph node label
* DONE [#C] URL normalization
  CLOSED: [2007-06-30 Сбт 20:10]
  For XFN spider `http://test.com`, `http://www.test.com` and
  `http://www.test.com/` are all different sites, so they are enlisted
  as different nodes in the resulting XML file!

  Workaround is to use pages' titles as labels of graph nodes.
  
  Currently `postprocess.xsl` seems to do the dupe-killing job well.
* TODO [#D] Multithread processing
