* TODO [#A] XFN extraction bug
  For example, `rel="cosmetics"` matches current patterns while it
  doesn't comply with XFN format.
* TODO [#A] URL normalization
  For XFN spider `http://test.com`, `http://www.test.com` and
  `http://www.test.com/` are all different sites, so they are enlisted
  as different nodes in the resulting XML file!

  Workaround is to use pages' titles as labels of graph nodes.

  Currently `postprocess.xsl` tries to delete dupes, but it also breaks
  relations to duplicating pages.
* TODO [#B] Respect hCard
* TODO [#C] Tags must be lowercased
  Currently tags are space-normalized at XFN processing but not
  translated to lowercase.
* TODO [#C] Page title may be way too long for a graph node label
* TODO [#D] Multithread processing
