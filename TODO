* TODO [#D] URL normalization
  For XFN spider `http://test.com`, `http://www.test.com` and
  `http://www.test.com/` are all different sites, so they are enlisted
  as different nodes in the resulting XML file.
  Workaround is to use pages' titles as labels of graph nodes.
  Is it a bug at all??
* TODO Tags must be case-insensitive
  They are normalized at XFN processing but not translated to
  lowercase.
* TODO Respect hCard
* TODO Page title may be way too long for a graph node label
* TODO [#D] Multithread processing
